# QSAR ML Challenge
QSAR machine learning challenge

## Objective
Develop a machine learning model to predict the binding affinities of reactive fragments and protein targets.

## Dataset
The dataset is a subset of [Kuljanin et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-00778-3) and consists of a set of reactive fragments and their corresponding binding affinities to specific protein targets (Dataset9):
- For each reactive fragment, we provide SMILES string and ECFP4 feature
- For each protein target, we provide Uniprot ID, gene symbol, and the binding site position
- Binding affinity is provided as competition ratios
